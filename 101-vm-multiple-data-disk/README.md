Create a Virtual Machine from a Windows Image with 4 Empty Data Disks
---

## Description

This is an Azure quickstart sample PowerShell script based on ARM template [101-vm-multiple-data-disk](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-vm-multiple-data-disk) from the repository [azure\azure-quickstart-templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates).

This script allows you to create a Windows Virtual Machine from a specified image during the template deployment and install the VM Diagnostics Extension. It also attaches 4 empty data disks. Note that you can specify the size of each of the empty data disks. This script also deploys a Storage Account, Virtual Network, Public IP addresses and a Network Interface, and it will deploy the following resources...

... and in-addition to it, just in-case if the deployment is not successful, then it will rollback the entire deployment.

> ### Note: 
> If the specified resource group is already exist then the script will not continue with the deployment.
