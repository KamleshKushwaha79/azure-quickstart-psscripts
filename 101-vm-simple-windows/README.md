---

## Description

This is a conversion of ARM template [101-vm-simple-windows](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-vm-simple-windows) from the repository [azure\azure-quickstart-templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates) to PowerShell Script.

This script allows you to deploy a simple Windows VM using a few different options for the Windows version, using the latest patched version. This will deploy a A2 size VM in the resource group location and return the fully qualified domain name of the VM, and it will deploy following the resources...
