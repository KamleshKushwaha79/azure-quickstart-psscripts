101-vm-secure-password
===
Very simple deployment of a Windows VM using password stored in Key Vault 
---

## Description

This is an Azure quickstart sample PowerShell script based on ARM template [101-vm-secure-password](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-vm-secure-password) from the repository [azure\azure-quickstart-templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates).

This script allows you to deploy a simple Windows VM by retrieving the password that is stored in a Key Vault. Therefore the password is never put in plain text in the script, and it will deploy the following resources...

> ### Key Vault reference

... and in-addition to it, just in-case if the deployment is not successful, then it will rollback the entire deployment.

> ### Note: 
> If the specified resource group is already exist then the script will not continue with the deployment.
