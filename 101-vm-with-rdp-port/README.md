Create a VM with an RDP port
---

## Description

This is a conversion of ARM template [101-vm-with-standardssd-disk](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-vm-with-standardssd-disk) from the repository [azure\azure-quickstart-templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates) to PowerShell Script.

This script allows you to create a NAT rule in loadbalancer to allow RDP to a vm, and it will deploy the following resources...

... and in-addition to it, just in-case if the deployment is not successful, then it will rollback the entire deployment.

> ### Note: 
> If the specified resource group is already exist then the script will not continue with the deployment.

## Syntax
```
Deploy-AzResource.ps1 [-ResourceGroupName] <string> [-Location] <string> [-VMName] <string> [-AdminCredential] <pscredential> [-DNSLabelPrefix] <string> [[-RDPPort] <int>] [<CommonParameters>]
